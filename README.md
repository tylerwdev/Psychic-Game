# Psychic-Game

This is a Javascript based game that consists of the user/player guessing a random letter chosen by the "computer."

The project creates a good mix of using HTML, CSS and Javascript all together.

This particular project bears resemblance to another Javascript game that is fairly common, "Rock, Paper, Scissors."
